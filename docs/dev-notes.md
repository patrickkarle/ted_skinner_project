  The one remaining pending task is "Plan project/subject nesting architecture for future" - this is noted for future work but wasn't explicitly requested to be done now. The application is running successfully with HMR and all
  styling changes are live.

> we need to have the return button work to activate the research action
the live response block has to always stay at the top of the interaction display window...
the token counting and phase changeover goes below
document creation should be happening at all times - all of the session phases should be saved in a phase document
the full synthesized document should be generated from the phase documents
each research generation should create it's own directory with phase directories therein and the final synthsized document in it's own directory
projects will supercede that and therefore it would be: project name / research subject name - manifest short name  / research subject name - manifest short name  - phase name / reseearch subject name-manifest short name -phase
name.md and .docx can we save as .docx? if not, then as pdf and open document standard
if no project then: research subject name - manifest short name  / research subject name -manifest short name - phase name / reseearch subject name-phase name.md and .docx can we save as .docx? if not, then as pdf and open
  document standard

it's super critical that every bit of the live response is saved - that is using a users data/tokens/money, so they deserve all of the generated content.
it is critical to keep that live response window a the top and the token expenditures below, can you have that token expended text be smaller
still need to fix the left side username and logout interaction - you've weirdly scaled that and changed the logout button. get rid of that horrid logout button. it's not at all in keeping. and make the user name and user icon
scaled down and properly symmetrical. i think your circle is slightly ovoid. and let's add the user option to change that icon and if we're adding the user name, location, etc. it needs to be in the output of the documents and in
the opening of the system session.
also, the phase display at the upper right of the display window - the completed phases are to be dark text, the unfinished are to be the light text, the current phase is to be halfway between text Context
Situation
Pain Mapping
Solutions
Brief
the left side of that display window should change from welcome [user name and if user has input name in settings, use profile name]
also the settings interactive is ugly it needs to match the elegance and beauty of the app. the sign out button is fucking gross. it needs to be like the "logout" button from the ui-preview
the user name again in that lower left corner needs to be much more elegant and pretty - the text weight is SOOOOO HEAVY. that lower left corner is the heaviest weight visually in the entire app. that's not right.
the three bar interaction in the session history (should be session history - current sessions) the interaction is buried and hidden, it does not come to front
I love the view prompts feature (should be view prompt and prompts if there are multiple) and we should be able to re-submit on a per phase basis since that's exposed and the user should be able to edit and then we will want to ask
- do you want to resubmit just this phase or additional phases. - this creates a means by which the user can complete an incomplete phase.
we need to be able to pause during research and allow restart from pause vs hard stop which may open a cancel this research inquiry?
  ⎿  UserPromptSubmit hook succeeded: Success
  
  
  
  in the system, please stop using those ugly, prebuilt icons, if we need to use such things, we should create elegant, graceful, beautiful things, not clumsy stupid looking things like those.
i don't think the folder icon in teh upper left navigation, next to the new button is aligned WITH the new button, perhaps we should create three bar navigation there - with manifest related interactions
the three bar navigation window, the highlighted item rectangle - one step darker on the color palette, the highlight rectangle should have the very tiny border
the three bar navigation window should be more tightly arranged, the size of the window can be smaller then and the color of the window should be the lightest of the color palette
session history higlight rectangle should have a tiny border
